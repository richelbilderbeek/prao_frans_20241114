# Reflection from supervisor

## What I did well

I think I:

- made Frans feel comfortable
- gave an assignment at the right level of complexity

Credits to Frans though, he was a breeze to work with.

## What I could do better

His GitHub repo had a mistake: that I would
meet him at the C11 entrance. I found out at 8:59,
so I was there, yet a couple of seconds late.

I've fixed the repo :-)

## My conclusion about Frans

Frans has been a great PRAO. Here I will write down the reasons why I think so.

- Frans was on time
- Frans was comfortable to talk: he shares his ideas,
  he is honest when not knowing something,
  he is honest when not finishing on time.
  Already for this, I think he's a great
  asset in any team.
- Frans came accross as confident: although I gave him a hard assignment,
  he just went to work and saw how far he gets
- Frans was autonomous. He worked mostly on his own and only discussed
  his progress in the break (as in a real work setting). 
- Frans' English is around fluent, except for a vocabulary with
  some missing specialized words

Would I give him a grade, I'd give him a 10 out of 10,
as I have no idea how he can improve.
I hope he does not become arrogant from that :-)

I recommend any PRAO that is similar to mine (i.e. having time
to think, no physical labour) to have him.
