# Report

Goal of a PRAO is to find out how it is like to work at a certain place.

This PRAO has two parts:

- work: work on something yourself
- interviews: find out how others like the place

## Report:
Today I have experienced how it is to work at BMC. I have tried to complete an assignment, but I did not finish.
I made a python script that was supposed to check which number is a prime number between 0 and 1 million for example.
The script didn't work as intended and I didn't have time to finish it.
