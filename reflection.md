# Reflection

The goal of a reflection is to improve.

One does so writing down how a passed day went:
what did yo do, how did it go and how can it be improved?

By forcing oneself to think of this, one can actually learn from the past.

## What did you do?
I experienced a day at work here on BMC and I tried to complete my python script to determine if which numbers between 0 and something was a prime number.
...

## What did you do well?
I think my code was good scince I have very little experience of coding and It was harder than it seemed at first.
...

## What can be improved?
I could have worked more efficiently and made sure I knew exactly what I were supposed to do, the first half I wasn't completely sure what I were supposed to do and lost time due to not doing right.
...

## What did you supervisor do well?
I think my supervisor was really nice and helped me when i asked for help. The assignment was really intresting and fun but a bit too hard. I still learned some more about coding, so I think my supervisor did well.
...

## How can you supervisor be improved?
The supervisor could maybe have made a little bit easier assignment scince I didn't manage to finish, but other than that I think everything was good!
...

## What would you do differently next time?
I would be more efficient, get a good idea of what im supposed to do before starting and dont be afraid to ask for help.
...

## Which tip would you give to future PRAO students?
Make sure to get a good idea of what to do before starting so that you don't loose time due to missunderstaning the assignment.
